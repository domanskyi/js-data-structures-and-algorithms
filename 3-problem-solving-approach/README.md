# Problem Solving Approach

**Main steps:**

- understand the problem
- explore concrete examples
- break it down
- solve or simplify
- look back and refactor

## Understand the problem

Ask yourself next questions, to understand the problem better

1. can I restate the problem in my own words?
2. what are the inputs?
3. what are the outputs?
4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? - do I have enough information to solve the problem?
5. how should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore concrete examples

1. start with simple examples
2. progress to more complex examples
3. explore each cases / empty inputs
4. explore invalid inputs

## Break it down

Write out the steps before writing a code

```js
const charCount = (str) => {
  // char - number/letter
  // make object to return at end
  // loop over string
  // if char AND a key in obj, increment counter
  // if char AND not a key in obj, add it to obj with 1
  // return oject at end
};
```

## Solve or simplify

1. find the core difficulty in what you`re trying to do
2. temporarily ignore that difficulty
3. write a simplified solution
4. then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look back & refactor

1. can you check the result?
2. can you derive the result differently?
3. can you understand it at a glance?
4. can you use the result or method for some other problem?
5. can you improve the performance of your solution?
6. can you think of other ways to refactor?
7. how have other people solved this problem?
